### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Hungarian hobby programmer who likes making fun and or useful applications and games, mainly on python, but I want to start learning html, javascript and c++ as well. 
I am still in middle school, but I hope I'll get into a good university and afterwards I want to work as a programmer/software developer!
